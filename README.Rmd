R library for stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests.

Port of the Ruby gem [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock)

<details> <summary><strong>How it works it way too much detail</strong></summary> <p>

The very very short version is: `webmockr` helps you stub HTTP requests so you 
don't have to repeat yourself.

**More details**

You tell `webmockr` what HTTP request you want to match against and if it sees a 
request matching your criteria it doesn't actually do the HTTP request. Instead,
it gives back the same object you would have gotten back with a real request, but 
only with the bits it knows about. For example, we can't give back the actual 
data you'd get from a real HTTP request as the request wasn't performed.

In addition, if you set an expectation of what `webmockr` should return, we 
return that. For example, if you expect a request to return a 418 error 
(I'm a Teapot), then that's what you'll get.

**Scenarios**

There's a few scenarios to think about when using `webmockr`:

* Real HTTP requests allowed:
* Real HTTP requests dis-allowed:
* Certain kinds of real HTTP requests allowed:
* xxxx:
* xxxx:

**Storing actual HTTP responses**

`webmockr` doesn't do that. You can use `vcr` for that.

## Features

* Stubbing HTTP requests at low http client lib level
* Setting and verifying expectations on HTTP requests
* Matching requests based on method, URI, headers and body
* Support for `testthat` coming soon via [vcr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/vcr)

## Supported HTTP libraries

* [crul](https://github.com/ropensci/crul) - an updated `crul` version is coming 
to CRAN soon, but not up as of today (2017-05-21)

> more to come

## Install

from cran

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("webmockr")
```

Dev version

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/webmockr")
```

```{r}
library(webmockr)
```

## Turn on webmockr

```{r}
webmockr::enable()
crul::mock()
```

## Outside a test framework

```{r}
library(crul)
```

### Stubbed request based on uri only and with the default response

```{r}
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get")
```

```{r}
x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org")
x$get('get')
```

set return objects

```{r}
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get") %>%
  wi_th(
    query = list(hello = "world")) %>%
    to_return(status = 418)
```

```{r}
x$get('get', query = list(hello = "world"))
```

### Stubbing requests based on method, uri and query params

```{r}
stub_request("get", "https://httpbin.org/get") %>%
  wi_th(query = list(hello = "world"), 
        headers = list('User-Agent' = 'libcurl/7.51.0 r-curl/2.6 crul/0.3.6', 
                       'Accept-Encoding' = "gzip, deflate"))
```

```{r}
stub_registry()
```

```{r}
x <- HttpClient$new(url = "https://httpbin.org")
x$get('get', query = list(hello = "world"))
```
